          <p className="aboutBody">
            Iâ€™m a highly motivated Senior Graphic Designer with seven years of
            experience in the areas of brand identity, brand development and
            packaging. There is a wide variety of design and creativity that
            falls under those pillars including advertising, web design,
            illustration and photography. From conceptualizing to creating, I am
            passionate about each project that I work on. There is no greater
            reward than seeing a finished product after putting your heart and
            soul into it. This is what drives me to be the best designer I can
            be, maintain a strong work ethic and go the extra mile.
